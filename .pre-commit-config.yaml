  # This pre-commit hook ensures that the config file is minimized and reflects exactly what you
  # intend to merge. Without it, you might run experiments with one config, but when merging upstream,
  # the config could silently fall back to the base defaults—resulting in different hyperparameters.
  #
  # For example, we've seen cases where an SFT recipe runs without a custom chat_template. When merged,
  # it unexpectedly picks up the default recommended chat_template from upstream, which doesn't match
  # the original experiment setup.
  #
  # If this check is disruptive, you can disable the pre-commit hook locally. However, before a recipe
  # is accepted upstream, we expect the config to be minimized.
  #
  # The minimize-check command infers the base config from each recipe's `defaults` key, so it
  # correctly handles inheritance chains (e.g., child → parent → grandparent).
